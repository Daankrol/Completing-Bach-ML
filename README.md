# Completing-Bach-ML

This repository contains the project done by Julian Bruinsma, Daan Krol, Jeroen van Brandenburg and Chiel Wijs (Group 04) for the Machine Learning course at the University of Groningen (20-21). The multinomial logistic regression model can be run by running the "logisitc_regression.py" file. To run both neural network models one may use the Jupyter Notebook under the file name "linear_model.ipynb". Examples of predicted music continuation can be found in the "audioSamples" folder.
